# mycantabria-scrapper

A scrapper for mycantabria.com

# TODO list

- pipe the `request` result to be able to return data from the scrapped web

# Install

`npm install`

# Build with gulp

`gulp`

# Run

`node dist/assset/js/scrapper.min.js` 

This will change soon to a more friendly way of running, such as `./scrapper`
that will run the right node.js script.
